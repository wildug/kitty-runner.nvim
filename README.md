# kitty-runner.nvim

Changed kitty-runner.lua to open new terminal in same os-window but new kitty window

This neovim plugin allows you to easily send lines from the current buffer to another kitty terminal. I use it mostly as a poor man's REPL, e.g. I start ipython in the kitty terminal and send buffer lines to it.

This plugin is inspired by and heavily borrows from [vim-kitty-runner](https://github.com/LkeMitchll/vim-kitty-runner).

If you run into trouble using the plugin or have suggestions for improvements, do open an issue! :)

# Functionality

The plugin implements the following commands:
- `:KittyOpenRunner`: Open a new kitty terminal (called a runner in the context of this plugin)
- `:KittySendLines`: Send the line at the current cursor position or the lines of current visual selection
- `:KittyRunCommand`: Prompt for a command and send it
- `:KittyReRunCommand`: Send the last command
- `:KittyClearRunner`: Clear the runner's screen
- `:KittyKillRunner`: Kill the runner

By default a number of keymaps are created (see below to turn this off):
- `<leader>to`: `:KittyOpenRunner`
- `<leader>tr`: `:KittyRunCommand`
- `<leader>ts`: `:KittySendLines`
- `<leader>tc`: `:KittyClearRunner`
- `<leader>tk`: `:KittyKillRunner`
- `<leader>tl`: `:KittyReRunCommand`

## Installation

With packer:

```lua
use {
  'jghauser/kitty-runner.nvim',
  config = function()
    require('kitty-runner').setup()
  end
}
```

## Configuration

The setup function allows adjusting various settings. By default it sets the following:

```lua
require('kitty-runner').setup({
  -- name of the kitty terminal:
  runner_name = 'kitty-runner-' .. uuid,
  -- kitty arguments when sending lines/command:
  run_cmd = {'send-text'},
  -- kitty arguments when killing a runner:
  kill_cmd = {'close-window'},
  -- use default keymaps:
  use_keymaps = true,
  -- the port used to communicate with the kitty terminal:
  kitty_port = 'unix:/tmp/kitty-' .. uuid,
})
```
